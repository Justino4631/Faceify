Faceify is a face recognition app.

The idea is to use this program with security cameras such as ring so it can tell you who's at your door.
It uses 3-5 pictures of people (in this case comedians Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, and Tim Robinson) then runs them through self made camera filters to make 30 new images.
These are then inputted as training data for the simple CNN I have.
